Commands & Permissions:
Visit the URL https://github.com/CheatSolutions/Important-Information/blob/main/documentation/commands_and_permissions.md to find out about Vacan's features and who can use them. When you have Vacan, just move your mouse over a command to see a detailed description.


Test the AntiCheat:
IP/Address: minecraft.vacan.idealistic.ai


For Developers:
Visit the URL https://github.com/CheatSolutions/Vacan-AntiCheat/tree/main/src/main/java/ai/idealistic/vacan/api to find out more about our Developer API. Our dedicated team made sure it has all the features that developers need.


Enable Bedrock Compatibility/Detections through Floodgate:
If you have a single server, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing the Geyser and Floodgate Minecraft plugins. If you have a network of servers behind proxy, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing Floodgate on both Proxy and backend servers along with matching the key.pem file to be the same everywhere and set the option “send-floodgate-data” to “true” on the Proxy configuration of the Floodgate Minecraft plugin


Detection Variables:
Vacan’s notifications often contain complex information usually in the form of text and numbers. This is the detection information, a collection of data that’s aimed to help the developers of the plugin better trace an issue to its roots. There’s no documentation of any of this but it should not worry you as it is not for you, the user.


Cheaper Purchase:
On the BuiltByBit platform you can purchase both “Vacan AntiCheat: Java Edition” and “Vacan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition” for 30% OFF via the URL https://builtbybit.com/resources/bundle/730. For the Polymart platform you can purchase both “Vacan AntiCheat: Java Edition” and “Vacan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition” for 30% OFF via the URL https://polymart.org/bundle/368.


Disabling the NPC:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Vacan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_npc” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/vacan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Disabling the Watermark:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Vacan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_watermark” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/vacan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Missing Version Notification:
When a user owns any version of Vacan, it may notify them of the missing opposite version. For example, if you own “Vacan AntiCheat: Java Edition” but not “Vacan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition”, Vacan will notify you that it cannot check bedrock players because you do not own “Vacan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition”. In such a scenario you need to optionally purchase the other version.


Using both “Vacan AntiCheat: Java Edition” and “Vacan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition” as one anti-cheat:
1. Requires prior ownership of both Java & Bedrock editions separately.
2. Ensure to add both editions into the plugin's folder even if one will not load.
3. Ensure to add your paypal-email under the Purchases category in the settings.yml file.
4. Ensure to add your patreon-full-name under the Purchases category in the settings.yml file.
5. Ensure to add your builtbybit-user-url under the Purchases category in the settings.yml file.


Enable Cross Server Notifications:
To enable this functionality, open the settings.yml and give a value to the option “server_name” under the “Important” category. This will specify which server this is so it can be included in future notifications and shared to other servers with the help of your SQL database. Don’t forget to run “/vacan reload” after making any configuration changes and of course to configure the sql.yml file for the database to be enabled.


Preventions and Punishments:
The Vacan AntiCheat adjusts itself by collecting and analyzing player data. In the initial stages of this data collection, such as the first days of having the plugin, there won’t be enough data for Vacan to prevent hacks or execute punishments, which will result in only notifications taking place. Once enough data is collected, preventions and finally punishments will be enabled.


Vacan works better with ProtocolLib:
Download the always latest ProtocolLib plugin version from its original developer via the URL: https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/ProtocolLib.jar
