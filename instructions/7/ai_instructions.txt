Enable Bedrock Compatibility/Detections through Floodgate:
If you have a single server, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing the Geyser and Floodgate Minecraft plugins. If you have a network of servers behind proxy, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing Floodgate on both Proxy and backend servers along with matching the key.pem file to be the same everywhere and set the option “send-floodgate-data” to “true” on the Proxy configuration of the Floodgate Minecraft plugin


Detection Variables:
Spartan’s notifications often contain complex information usually in the form of text and numbers. This is the detection information, a collection of data that’s aimed to help the developers of the plugin better trace an issue to its roots. There’s no documentation of any of this but it should not worry you as it is not for you, the user.

Disabling the NPC:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Spartan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_npc” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/spartan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Disabling the Watermark:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Spartan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_watermark” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/spartan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Missing Version Notification:
When a user owns any version of Spartan, it may notify them of the missing opposite version. For example, if you own “Spartan AntiCheat: Java Edition” but not “Spartan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition”, Spartan will notify you that it cannot check bedrock players because you do not own “Spartan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition”. In such a scenario you need to purchase the opposite version which can then be upgraded via our Patreon.


Using both “Spartan AntiCheat: Java Edition” and “Spartan AntiCheat: Bedrock Edition”:
To use all editions of the Spartan AntiCheat together and avoid the console error “Ambiguous plugin name” navigate to the #my-account Discord text-channel and download only one of the editions, this choice is yours. Upon loading the edition you downloaded, the other editions will load automatically by checking your purchases.


Enable Cross Server Notifications:
To enable this functionality, open the settings.yml and give a value to the option “server_name” under the “Important” category. This will specify which server this is so it can be included in future notifications and shared to other servers with the help of your SQL database. Don’t forget to run “/spartan reload” after making any configuration changes and of course to configure the sql.yml file for the database to be enabled.


Preventions and Punishments:
The Spartan AntiCheat adjusts itself by collecting and analyzing player data. In the initial stages of this data collection, such as the first days of having the plugin, there won’t be enough data for Spartan to prevent hacks or execute punishments, which will result in only notifications taking place. Once enough data is collected, preventions and finally punishments will be enabled.


How “Detection Slots” work:
Detection Slots determine how many players Spartan can check simultaneously for cheating. With more Detection Slots, you can check more players at once. If you have fewer Detection Slots than online players, players will be checked in groups sequentially instead of all at once.
